Just a quick project to mimic Zentry website that I like, for fun.

It's using Next.js 15+, React 19+ and TailwindCSS 4+. Also using GSAP to start and then I started to migrate to Motion to learn a bit, with the goal to have a better understanding of the differences between them and remove GSAP from the project later.
